# Giphy Search With ASP.NET Core
## Using Razor Pages

This repository holds the demo code for a simple Giphy search app. It utilizes Razor pages, Boostrap, and Giphy's HTTP API.

### Giphy API

To get started, you'll need a Giphy API token. You can register at the official Giphy Developer page. (https://developers.giphy.com/).

There are two kinds of apps: SDK & API. Both will work, but you only need API.

### Technology

You'll need .NET Core 3.1 which you can install from https://dot.net. After this is installed, you can run the `GiphySearch` project.

```
dotnet run
```
